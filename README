Rasterday is a piece of Rack middleware to let you use SVGs transparently, even
in the face of browsers that hate SVGs.  It does this by conditionally
translating your application's SVG images to GIFs or PNGs when it thinks the
browser won't handle the SVG properly, or on a trigger you specify.

The short version is to put this in your config.ru so that it can intercept SVG
images that come back from anything deeper in the stack (e.g., your application,
or Rack::Static, or similar).

See doc/examples for example usage.  If you figure out how to use it with Rails,
I'd be interested in an example.

See doc/TODO for what the author intends to do.  See doc/LICENSE for licensing
