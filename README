The short answer is to put this in your config.ru so that it can intercept SVG
images that come back from anything deeper in the stack (e.g., your application,
or Rack::Static, or similar).

See doc/examples for example usage.  If you figure out how to use it with Rails,
I'd be interested in an example.
